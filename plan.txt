    MARKET DATA DISSEMINATION SYSTEM: DETAILED ROADMAP
============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------
                   PROJECT OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------

This project converts an existing C++ order book simulator into a 
market data dissemination system using gRPC to stream order book 
data and trade information to multiple clients in real-time.

------------------------------------------------------------
                   DESIGN PRINCIPLES
------------------------------------------------------------

1. SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
  - Simulator logic remains independent from communication layer
  - Thread management separate from business logic
  - Clear interfaces between components

2. THREAD SAFETY
  - All shared resources protected appropriately
  - Lock hierarchy to prevent deadlocks
  - Minimal lock contention in critical paths

3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
  - Lock-free algorithms where appropriate
  - Efficient memory management and minimal allocation
  - Batching of updates when possible

4. RELIABILITY
  - Graceful handling of client disconnections
  - Proper shutdown sequence for all components
  - Comprehensive error recovery

------------------------------------------------------------
           ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENTS & PATTERNS
------------------------------------------------------------

1. THREADING MODEL
  - Producer-Consumer pattern for data flow
  - Thread pool for handling client connections
  - Observer pattern for event notifications

2. COMMUNICATION MECHANISMS
  - Thread-safe queue (blocking and non-blocking operations)
  - Condition variables for thread synchronization
  - Atomic operations for lock-free counters

3. GRPC COMPONENTS
  - Service definitions in Protocol Buffers
  - Server-streaming RPC for market data updates
  - Unary RPC for control operations

4. DESIGN PATTERNS
  - Factory pattern for creating various components
  - Adapter pattern for simulator integration
  - Strategy pattern for customizable behaviors

------------------------------------------------------------
                   CRITICAL PATH
------------------------------------------------------------

The most critical components that should be prioritized:

1. Thread-safe queue implementation (foundation for all thread communication)
2. gRPC server implementation (enables client connectivity)
3. Simulator adapter (connects data source to communication layer)

Dependencies:
- Phase 2 must be completed before Phase 3
- Phase 3 and Phase 4 can be partially developed in parallel
- Phase 5 requires all previous phases to be functional

------------------------------------------------------------
                   SUCCESS CRITERIA
------------------------------------------------------------

The project will be considered successful when:

1. Market data flows correctly from simulator to clients
2. System remains stable under specified load conditions:
  - Up to 100,000 updates per second
  - At least 50 simultaneous client connections
  - 24-hour continuous operation without degradation
3. Latency remains below target thresholds:
  - Average end-to-end latency < 5ms
  - 99th percentile latency < 20ms
4. Clean shutdown occurs under all tested conditions
5. Documentation is complete and accurate

------------------------------------------------------------
                   RISKS AND MITIGATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

1. PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS
  Risk: System cannot handle required throughput
  Mitigation: Early performance testing, profiling, incremental optimization

2. THREAD SYNCHRONIZATION ISSUES
  Risk: Race conditions or deadlocks in multi-threaded code
  Mitigation: Thread safety analysis, extensive testing, code review

3. MEMORY MANAGEMENT
  Risk: Memory leaks or excessive allocation
  Mitigation: Memory profiling, smart pointer usage, allocation tracking

4. GRPC INTEGRATION COMPLEXITY
  Risk: gRPC integration more complex than anticipated
  Mitigation: Start with simple prototype, incremental feature addition

5. SIMULATOR COMPATIBILITY
  Risk: Existing simulator difficult to integrate
  Mitigation: Create clean adapter interface, minimal changes to simulator
